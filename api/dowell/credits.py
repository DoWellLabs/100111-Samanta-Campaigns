    #### Context manager for deducting DowellUser credits on usage of DowellService in the context block.

        # Use service
        pass

    # Here the required amount of credits for the service and/or subservice is deducted on exiting the context manager if the function runs successfully and no exception is raised
    with DeductUserCreditsOnServiceUse(user, service, subservices, count):
        function_that_uses_a_dowell_service(*args, **kwargs)
    
    # Here the required amount of credits for the service and/or subservice is deducted manually
    with DeductUserCreditsOnServiceUse(user, service, subservices, auto_deduct=False) as user_credits_manager:
        try:
            function_that_uses_a_dowell_service(*args, **kwargs)

        except:
            # Do not deduct credits if an exception is raised
            pass
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the async version of the context manager:
    ```
    async def function_that_uses_a_dowell_service(*args, **kwargs):
        # Use service
        pass
    
    async with DeductUserCreditsOnServiceUse(user, service, subservices, count):
        await function_that_uses_a_dowell_service(*args, **kwargs)
    ```

    You can also use the context manager as a means to check if all prerequisites for using a service are met before using the service:
    ```
    ensure_prerequisites_are_met_before_service_use = dowell.DeductUserCreditsOnServiceUse(
        user=user, 
        service=service, 
        auto_deduct=False, 
    )
    with ensure_prerequisites_are_met_before_service_use:
        # Use service
        pass
    ```
